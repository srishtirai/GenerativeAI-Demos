# Generative AI Notebooks

This repository contains Notebook files covering various concepts in Generative AI. Each notebook demonstrates practical implementations of models and techniques used in AI research and applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Demonstrates how RAG improves source citation and prevents hallucinations in AI-generated responses.

### Neural Network Classifier for Loan Data
- Builds a neural network to classify loan decisions.
- Experiments with different hidden layer sizes, activation functions, and architectures to find the best-performing model.

### LangChain Implementation
- Implements LangChain with an example that involves:
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Input/output parsing
  - Output formatting

### CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN
- Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR-10 images.
- Studies the impact of:
  - Batch Normalization and Dropout
  - Number of convolution and pooling layers
  - Activation functions

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with CIFAR-10
- Modifies the GAN architecture by adding convolutional and transposed convolution layers.
- Trains the model to generate images for a selected CIFAR-10 class.

### BERT for Text Classification
- Uses a pretrained BERT model to classify a corpus into at least three categories.
- Demonstrates how transformer-based models handle text classification.

### Autoencoders (Vanilla & Variational) with MNIST
- Trains both a Vanilla Autoencoder and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on the MNIST dataset.
- Detaches the decoders and generates images from latent vectors.
- Compares the quality of generated images from both models.
- Includes a set of slides summarizing findings.
